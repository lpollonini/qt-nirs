# What is QT-NIRS?

**Q**uality **T**esting NIRS is a MATLAB-based tool for the quality control of fNIRS measurements after data acquisition. Based on the photoplethysmographic waveform of the raw fNIRS scans, QT-NIRS is able to identify high- and low-quality fNIRS data at a subject, channel, or time-window level. The data quality is quantified using two metrics: the *scalp coupling index* (SCI) and *peak spectrum power* (PSP). After the quality control process, QT-NIRS can identify poor-quality data segments that can be corrected by external algorithms. Otherwise, QT-NIRS can select a subset of subjects (or channels) to be discarded from the analysis. Consequently, the number of spurious functional activations tends to decrease.

## Advantages 

Vendor tools aimed to the quality assurance rely on the calibration process to enhance the *signal-to-noise ratio* (SNR). This process optimizes the fNIRS optodes gain at the beginning of the data collection. However, the optodes-scalp coupling is likely to change as the subject goes through the experimental tasks.
