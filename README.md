# QT-NIRS

QT-NIRS (Quality Testing of Near Infrared Scans)  performs and presents a post-experimental assessment of quality across time and optical channels of an fNIRS recording in an intuitive and time-effective manner, and it provides actionable information for the optimization of subsequent steps of the fNIRS analytical pipeline.

**UPDATE: In order to read SNIRF files, QTNIRS uses the SNIRF class and methods from Homer3. This is a provisional measure to work with SNIRF while we work with an independent solution.**
